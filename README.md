# 📖 **Dictionary with Red-Black Tree**

A **Dictionary** application that implements a **Red-Black Tree (RBT)** for efficient data storage and retrieval. This project uses advanced data structures to ensure balanced tree operations, delivering optimal search, insert, and delete functionalities.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- 🔍 **Efficient Search**: Quickly find definitions using Red-Black Tree properties.
- ➕ **Add Words**: Seamlessly insert new words into the dictionary.
- 📝 **Edit or Delete**: Update existing entries or remove them entirely.
- 📊 **Balanced Tree**: Ensures consistent performance with O(log n) operations.
- 🌐 **User-Friendly UI**: Clean, intuitive interface for easy navigation.

## 📚 **How It Works**
### **Red-Black Tree Basics**
The Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree with the following properties:
1. Each node is either **red** or **black**.
2. The root is always **black**.
3. All leaves (NIL nodes) are **black**.
4. Red nodes cannot have red children (no two consecutive red nodes).
5. Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes has the same number of black nodes.

### **Operations**
- **Insert**: Adds a new word with rebalancing.
- **Search**: Finds a word efficiently using the tree structure.
- **Delete**: Removes a word and ensures the tree remains balanced.
